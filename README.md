# 2Do_tasks

heres a link to the deployed site:

Project description: For this project we needed to create a simple task board for handling and managing new tasks in order to complete them.

Skills implemented: Javascript, HTML, CSS

To the best of my ability, I used a random math code and made a unique task ID randomizer to attach to each new task card created. From there moved on down the starter code to create functions for creating tasks, saving the information to local stortageand then rendering taskcards afterwards. We used a modal as the submit form and we needed to make the modal form hide and reveal itself through click events for the add task buttons. Also needed to make th cards draggable and be able to pin the cards to different categories of the task board.

Lessons learned: I feel as though I've made some progress with my javascript coding, I'm starting to understand a bit more on what I'm actually typing out as far as the code. I'm still struggling with knowing exactly where to start for certain things but once I get the ball rolling I start to work things out. When I've gotten the tutoring done most of the time they say its just some order issues or naming conventions that through my code off. But I had a few moments when I was recieving help from tutors and ended either being correct in how my code was written to begin with or even corrected the tutors on a few instances.
